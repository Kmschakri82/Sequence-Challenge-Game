# Sequence-Challenge-Game
The Sequence Game is a classic memory game where players must repeat an increasingly long sequence of colors or sounds. Itâ€™s designed to test memory, attention, and pattern recognition
How it Works

Game Start: The game randomly lights up one color (or plays one sound).
Player Response: The player must press the same color button in the correct order.
Sequence Growth: If the player is correct, the game adds another color to the sequence.
Game Over: If the player presses the wrong color, the game ends and shows the score.

Key Components
Colors / Buttons: Usually 4 colors (Red, Blue, Green, Yellow). Each has a corresponding sound.
Sequence Storage: The game stores the sequence internally and compares it with the player's input.
Score: Typically based on how many steps the player successfully remembers.

Technologies to Build Sequence Game
You can implement a Simon Game using several technologies. Example:
Frontend Web Game: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
Mobile App: Flutter or React Native
Desktop App: Python (Tkinter or Pygame)

Example Logic in Python (Pygame/Tkinter)

Generate a random sequence of colors.
Show sequence to the player (highlight buttons one by one).
Take player input and check against sequence.
Repeat with an extra color if correct, or end if wrong.
